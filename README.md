# I2C_Pullup_Resistor_Calculation

I2C pull-up resistor calculation:

  - The script creates graphs for all modes [Standard Mode, Fast Mode, Fast Mode Plus] for given application parameters
  - Parameters are fully configurable to adjust different applications having multiple master and slave devices
  - Extensive graphical representation gives the user the ability to see the pull-up resistance range in a better way
  - Following graphs are included:
       - Bus capacitance vs pull-up resistance
       - Leakage current vs pull-up resistance
       - Supply voltage vs pull-up resistance
            - Sink = 2 mA
            - Sink = 3 mA
       - Example application pull-up resistance range for the following modes [Fully configurable]
            - Standard Mode
            - Fast Mode
            - Fast Mode Plus
